# Explainable AI Credit Scoring Engine

This module demonstrates a simple, explainable credit scoring engine using Python, scikit-learn, and SHAP.

## Features
- Synthetic financial data generation
- Random Forest model for credit prediction
- SHAP for feature impact and reason codes
- Outputs reason codes for quest system integration

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the engine:
   ```bash
   python credit_xai.py
   ```

## Output
- Classification report
- SHAP summary plot (feature impacts)
- Reason codes for a sample prediction

## Extend
- Replace synthetic data with real user data
- Integrate with quest system and UI
- Add more features or models as needed
